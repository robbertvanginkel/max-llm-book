## Adding the language model head

In this step, you'll create the `GPT2LMHeadModel` - the complete language model that can predict next tokens. This class wraps the transformer from Step 10 and adds a final linear layer that projects 768-dimensional hidden states to 50,257-dimensional vocabulary logits.

The language model head is a single linear layer without bias. For each position in the sequence, it outputs a score for every possible next token. Higher scores indicate the model thinks that token is more likely to come next.

At 768 × 50,257 = 38.6M parameters, the LM head is the single largest component in GPT-2, representing about 33% of the model's 117M total parameters. This is larger than all 12 transformer blocks combined.

## Understanding the projection

The language model head performs a simple linear projection using MAX's [`Linear`](https://docs.modular.com/max/api/python/nn/module_v3#max.nn.module_v3.Linear) layer. It maps each 768-dimensional hidden state to 50,257 scores, one per vocabulary token.

The layer uses `bias=False`, meaning it only has weights and no bias vector. This saves 50,257 parameters (about 0.4% of model size). The bias provides little benefit because the layer normalization before the LM head already centers the activations. Adding a constant bias to all logits wouldn't change the relative probabilities after softmax.

The output is called "logits," which are raw scores before applying softmax. Logits can be any real number. During text generation (Step 12), you'll convert logits to probabilities with softmax. Working with logits directly enables techniques like temperature scaling and top-k sampling.

## Understanding the complete model

With the LM head added, you now have the complete GPT-2 architecture:

1. **Input**: Token IDs `[batch, seq_length]`
2. **Embeddings**: Token + position `[batch, seq_length, 768]`
3. **Transformer blocks**: 12 blocks process the embeddings `[batch, seq_length, 768]`
4. **Final layer norm**: Normalizes the output `[batch, seq_length, 768]`
5. **LM head**: Projects to vocabulary `[batch, seq_length, 50257]`
6. **Output**: Logits `[batch, seq_length, 50257]`

Each position gets independent logits over the vocabulary. To predict the next token after position i, you look at the logits at position i. The highest scoring token is the model's top prediction.

You'll use the following MAX operations to complete this task:

**Linear layer**:

## Implementing the language model

You'll create the `GPT2LMHeadModel` class that wraps the transformer with a language modeling head. The implementation is straightforward, with just two components and a simple forward pass.

First, import the required modules. You'll need `Linear` and `Module` from MAX, plus the previously implemented `GPT2Config` and `GPT2Model`.

In the `__init__` method, create two components:
- Transformer: `GPT2Model(config)` stored as `self.transformer`
- LM head: `Linear(config.n_embd, config.vocab_size, bias=False)` stored as `self.lm_head`

Note the `bias=False` parameter, which creates a linear layer without bias terms.

In the `forward` method, implement a simple two-step process:
1. Get hidden states from the transformer: `hidden_states = self.transformer(input_ids)`
2. Project to vocabulary logits: `logits = self.lm_head(hidden_states)`
3. Return `logits`

That's it. The model takes token IDs and returns logits. In the next step, you'll use these logits to generate text.

**Implementation** (`step_11.py`):

```python
{{#include ../../steps/step_11.py}}
```

**Next**: In [Step 12](./step_12.md), you'll implement text generation using sampling and temperature control to generate coherent text autoregressively.
